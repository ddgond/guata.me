        description: "jusaber is a quick game i threw together on a 6-hour flight that takes maps from beat saber and plays them as if they were jubeat maps. i had recently been in japan and was disappointed that i could never find japanese rhythm games in american arcades. i originally wanted to make a standard jubeat emulator, but realized that i would then have to make my own maps in order to be able to enjoy and play it. that was out of scope for such a short flight, so i adapted by simply using beat saber maps and a 4x3 grid rather than the standard 4x4. this also turned out to be a good move as the smaller grid makes it easier to keep your fingers in the right place on the keyboard. finally, beat saber maps turn out to be perfect for jubeat-style play and are incredibly fun to play in this way. since it is playable and i'm kinda busy with other things, i don't intend to develop it further in the forseeable future, but it would be nice to at least improve the interface at some point.",
